# ============================================================
# ShowPilot — Server Dockerfile
# ============================================================
# Two-stage build:
#   Stage 1 (builder) — installs build tools, compiles native deps
#                       (better-sqlite3, bcrypt). Heavy.
#   Stage 2 (runtime) — Alpine + Node + the compiled node_modules. Lean.
#
# Final image is roughly 130-150 MB. better-sqlite3 needs python3 + make +
# g++ at build time; we don't include them in the runtime image.
# ============================================================

# ---------- Stage 1: build native dependencies ----------

# Copy only manifests first so this layer caches across rebuilds when
# package.json hasn't changed. (Big deal — recompiling better-sqlite3 takes 30s+)
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install production deps. Prefer `npm ci` when a lockfile is present (faster,
# deterministic). Fall back to `npm install` if no lockfile exists yet — this
# lets the Dockerfile work right after `git clone` even if the project hasn't
# committed a package-lock.json. Lockfile users get pinned versions; non-lock
# users get the latest matching package.json semver ranges.

# ---------- Stage 2: runtime ----------
FROM node:24-alpine

# Minimal runtime deps. tini is a tiny init that handles signals correctly —
# without it, SIGTERM from `docker stop` doesn't reach the Node process
# cleanly, and the container takes 10s to die instead of 1s.

# Don't ship any local config that snuck in (would leak secrets), but DO keep
# config.example.js — server.js falls back to it if config.js isn't mounted,
# making "docker run" smoke-test friendly without compromising security
# (config.example.js has placeholder values, not real secrets).
